# Croppic Extended 
## Overview
This purpose of this fork of the original [croppic](https://github.com/styoe/croppic) has been to extend the functionality beyond what was offerred by the original author(s). 

Namely, thus far, the following have been:

1. Option to supply completely custom upload behavior (to allow for IE9 or any other custom behavior)
2. Ability to zoom from the original cropping area when using a modal
3. Reading an image directly into the DOM instead of uploading the image to a server first
4. Moving the CSS to LESS

See full documentation for the original version at <http://www.croppic.net/>

## Usage Restrictions
Additional documentation for this fork of the original croppic coming soon.

works in IE 10+, chrome, and ffx (opera coming soon)

Uses FormData so no IE9 and prev versions support unless you use a custom upload method.
